<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Hardin Eli Ross IV but most people call me Hunter. I love technology, the outdoors, playing soccer and almost all sports. In college I received scholarship money for dodgeball at the University of Alabama, where I majored in Criminal Justice, with a minor in Computer Science. In 2015 I played professional soccer for two months. After being cut I started working at an arcade and then began working as a paralegal. In 2016 I began working at an Investing Company in Chapel Hill. I soon began to adopt other hobbies and passions. This is when I found the Coding program at UNC Chapel Hill.  </p>
